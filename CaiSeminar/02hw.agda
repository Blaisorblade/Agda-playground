-- Problem 1: Sorting.
-- Write a series of functions that help to sort a list
-- of natural numbers.

-- Problem 1.1:
-- Given 2 natural numbers x, y, decide whether x ≤ y.
leNat : ℕ → ℕ → Bool
leNat x y = {!!}

-- Problem 1.2:
-- Given a number y and a list xs, insert y into xs before
-- the first number in xs bigger than or equal to y.
insert : ℕ → List ℕ → List ℕ
insert y xs = {!!}

-- Problem 1.3:
-- Implement insertion sort.
-- (Optional: implement a sorting algorithm that is not
-- insertion sort.)
sort : List ℕ → List ℕ
sort xs = {!!}

-- Problem 2: Hailstorm numbers (oeis.org/A006577)
-- Compute the next natural number in the 3x+1 problem:
-- If x is even, divide x by 2.
-- If x is odd, the result is 3x+1.
-- (Optional: write a function `hailstorm` such that
-- `hailstorm i` is the ith number in A006577. You may
-- need to disable the termination checker.)
nextHail : ℕ → ℕ
nextHail = {!!}

-- Problem 3: Matrix transposition.
-- Write a series of functions leading up to matrix
-- transposition.

-- Matrices are represented as a sequence of rows.
Matrix : Set → ℕ → ℕ → Set
Matrix A m n = Vec (Vec A n) m

-- Matrix transposition turns m-by-n matrices into
-- n-by-m matrices. Rows become columns and columns
-- become rows. Here is its signature; we will implement
-- it later.
transpose : ∀ {A m n} → Matrix A m n → Matrix A n m

-- Problem 3.1:
-- Define a polymorphic function mapVec that applies
-- a function on all elements of a vector.
--
-- mapVec suc (1 ∷ 2 ∷ 3 ∷ 4 ∷ []) =
--   (2 ∷ 3 ∷ 4 ∷ 5 ∷ [])
--
mapVec : ∀ {A B : Set} {n} → (A → B) → Vec A n → Vec B n
mapVec f xs = {!!}

-- Problem 3.2:
-- Fill a size-n vector with x.
fill : ∀ {A : Set} → (n : ℕ) → A → Vec A n
fill n x = {!!}

-- Problem 3.3:
-- Given a vector of functions and vector of arguments,
-- compute the vector of results.
pointwiseApp : ∀ {A B : Set} {n} → Vec (A → B) n → Vec A n → Vec B n
pointwiseApp fs xs = {!!}

-- Problem 3.4:
-- Implement matrix transposition.
--
-- Hints:
--
-- 1. The transpose of a 0-by-2 matrix is a 2-by-0 matrix.
--    In our representation, 2-by-2 matrices and 2-by-0
--    matrices are different.
--
-- 2. The easiest way to define matrix transposition is
--    obtained by thinking about how the transpose of a
--    matrix is obtained from the transpose of its submatrix
--    without the first row.
--
-- (Optional: Implement matrix transposition in a different
-- way, e. g., through the function obtaining the ith column
--
--   getColumn : ∀ {A m n} → Fin n → Matrix A m n → Vec A m
--
-- You may need to read the library Data.Fin.

-- transpose : ∀ {A m n} → Matrix A m n → Matrix A n m
transpose xss = {!!}
